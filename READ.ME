As users playing a two player game we want to:

1. enter our names and have them displayed
2. have our order chosen for us by the game
3. take turns placing our marks in empty spaces
4. not be able to place our marks in an occupied space
5. be told when a move causes a player to win, or to draw
6. start the game over without having to reset the browser
